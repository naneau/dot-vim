# My VIM setup

Based on [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle). Rolling my own VIM setup instead of relying on tools such as [Janus](https://github.com/carlhuda/janus) has been a great way to learn about various VIM niceties.

Meant to be installed into `~/.vim`, there's an install.sh that symlinks the necessary dotfiles.
